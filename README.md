## Minimal Monkey Blog

### Overview

Hello, my name is [Stephen Burgess](https://twitter.com/minimalmonkey) and this repo contains the source code for my site [www.minimalmonkey.github.io](http://minimalmonkey.github.io/)

*NOTE: The site is not yet finished and is very much work in progress.*

### Contributing

This code is a sort of portfolio to show what I can do. Therefore, I'm not accepting pull requests for the site as I want to keep the code mostly mine. You can folk the repo and do as you want and I'd really appreciate you reporting any bugs you find [here](https://github.com/minimalmonkey/minimalmonkey.github.io/issues).
